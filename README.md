About
-----
The goal of this WPF application that was to make the default tiny UI that comes with 4K resolution, larger and playable.

Current State
-------------
This code was put together using relatively new concepts for me, so do not expect any level of optimization. Over time I will go through
and comment and clean up everything. When everything is cleaned up and easy to follow, I'll make an explanation video dissecting the code to help push the progress.

How to use
----------
With the 4kMagnifier running in the background, and Age of Empires 2: HD running (NOTE: currently software looks only for HD edition)
press crtl+F4, to toggle show/hide. You may have to toggle twice.
Pressing ctrl+F5 will close the 4kMagnifier. The application will continue to run in the background until closed.
